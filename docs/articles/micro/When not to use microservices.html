  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the past 4 years, most of the teams I’ve
been working with have expressed some form of interest in refactoring to microservices.
This topology seems to have become the <em>de facto</em> standard. And it’s
understandable, given the promises that come with: resiliency, HA,
low coupling, agility. They’re <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_novelty">appealing</a>
because they fix issues that everyone faced with monoliths.</p>

<p>As of late, a few reservations and precautions seem to have
gained attention regarding them<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/microservices/#fn:11" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>But aren’t microservices awesome? Shouldn’t
everyone just accept and adopt them now?</p>

<p>In this post I want to discuss the application of microservices, 
what are some of their downsides, and situations
in which case their use should be re-considered very carefully.</p>

<h1 id="what-are-microservices">What are microservices</h1>

<p>There are plenty of definitions to microservices. Unfortunately the
origin to the term itself is not 100% clear, which means that anyone’s
is as good as another’s<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/microservices/#fn:10" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Overall there still seems to be consensus at an industry level on
a base set of features that characterize microservices, which are summarized as the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microservices are a pattern that applies to component 
design
(how things are grouped together) and deployment 
architecture
(how things are deployed and communicate).</p>

  <p>Microservices are applicable to distributed applications
of a “certain functional complexity”.</p>

  <p>They prescribe
that services be kept small, grouped by function, implement
separation of concerns, stay autonomous and decoupled from 
one another, can be deployed and versioned and scaled 
independently,
communicate through a mix of lightweight APIs and 
asynchronous channels,
have their own state, and that this state be accessed only
through the service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You typical implementation of the pattern looks like so:</p>

<p><img src="./assets/typical-deployment.png" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>A set of services with their front-end (composed of an API, and a UI
  component - or not), a domain layer implementing the logic for the service’s
  domain, and its own data store.</li>
  <li>Front-end composites, that compose all front-end components (UI or API) into
  consistent front-ends (UI composite or API gateway)</li>
  <li>An event bus, serving as backbone for asynchronous communication.</li>
</ul>

<p>The main issue is that the consensus on applicable use-cases the pattern is 
fairly wide. Which is 
why I want to take the
opposite approach and try to identify <strong>when microservices
might not be the best option</strong> available.</p>

<h1 id="the-challenges-of-microservices">The challenges of microservices</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>Programmers know the benefits of everything and the trade-offs of nothing.</p>

  <p>~ Rich Hickey (Designer of Clojure)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are trade-offs to implementing microservices. Since the point
of this article is not to bash them, I will try to be concise:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Microservices are <strong>hard to design</strong> correctly. There are entire 
<a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/microservices-antipatterns-and/9781492042716/">books</a> written on
 their pitfalls. It takes (a lot of)
 iterations to land on a satisfying domain design and boundaries. Several
 fundamental and structuring  questions don’t have straight forward answers 
 and will require tweaking and iterations, such as:
 how to manage <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/introduction-to-microservices-part-4-dependencies/">cross cutting concerns</a> (share, but couple, don’t share, but
 duplicate), how to share data and what level to replication to have, how to
 manage reporting, whether to include UI components in the services, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They come with a host of <strong>technical complexities</strong>, which have been
 documented in great details. The most quoted is probably
 <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/4/8/microservices-not-a-free-lunch.html">“microservices - not a free lunch”</a>. Some of the challenges includes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>they <strong>multiply the number of APIs</strong>
  <img src="./assets/APIs.png" alt="">
  This makes changes harder
  and introduce versioning complexities, and decrease your ability to change
  the functional decomposition of your services<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/microservices/#fn:12" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>they <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/architect-microservice-container-applications/communication-in-microservice-architecture#asynchronous-microservice-integration-enforces-microservices-autonomy">introduce <strong>network latency</strong></a> and introduce a trade between
  scalability and increased response time when composing 
  services<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/microservices/#fn:13" class="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><a href="https://blog.christianposta.com/microservices/the-hardest-part-about-microservices-data/"><strong>transactions across several services are complex</strong></a> 
  because of the CAP theorem<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/microservices/#fn:15" class="footnote">5</a></sup>. As opposed to monoliths with a
  single database, they are usually not handled by the 
  infrastructure.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>debugging distributed systems is complex</strong> (see 
  “microservices - not a free lunch”). Asynchronous systems, inter-service locking
  and race conditions are hard to troubleshoot<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/microservices/#fn:16" class="footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>These complexities are not insurmountable, but they are
 more technical details to consider rather than focusing on the
 business functions that bring value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They require an <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html#OrganizedAroundBusinessCapabilities"><strong>organization shift</strong></a> 
 to autonomous, cross-functional teams. This
 is a crucial step, as per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway&#39;s_law">Conway’s law</a>.
 That means front end and back end devs, data platform engineers, QAs, 
 product managers, and ops mixed in a single team.</p>

    <p><img src="./assets/organization.png" alt=""></p>

    <p>This works smoothly because most of the dependencies are internal
 to each team, and since priorities are the same, they tend to 
 resolve quickly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They require <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MicroservicePrerequisites.html">a change of process and practices</a>. 
 From a few large releases once in a while, to a lot of small releases often. From ticket-based provisioning, to self-service
 coded infrastructure.</p>

    <p><img src="./assets/organization-process-architecture.png" alt="organization &lt;-&gt; process &lt;-&gt; architecture" width="450px"></p>

    <p>The <strong>success of a microservice architecture depends on the 
 capacity of organization and process to change</strong>, and those 
 are the hardest things to reform.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The technical challenges discussed above mean that the <strong>team’s skillset
 needs to be extended</strong>, for every specialty. They will need to understand
 distributed systems, devops, infra as code, different types of databases,
 composing and componentizing front-ends, unit-testing everything, releasing
 to production without manual intervention, iterating and failing, planning
 very small releases, testing in prod, managing several versions, and etc.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="when-microservices-should-seriously-be-questioned">When microservices should seriously be questioned</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>application is too small</strong> to justify micro-services<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/microservices/#fn:1" class="footnote">7</a></sup>. And sure, it
 might grow in the future, and have entire domains added to it ; in which case, 
 switch to microservices when they actually approaching the threshold of RoI.
 A similar reasoning can be applied to small teams.</p>

    <p><img src="./assets/costs.png" alt="" width="450px"></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>domain is unclear or uncertain</strong>, which makes the domain model uncertain.
 This happens when the product is described as “a portal”, when your start a
 start-up, when what is initially CRM might actually also manage orders, and 
 maybe delivery, we’ll see, let’s be open.</p>

    <p>Boundaries will move, interfaces will change, models will split, aggregates
 will consolidate. In this case, the worst idea is to create stickiness to
 the application architecture by having hard-to-change contracts and hard-to-change
 clients. <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/refactor.html">You need to refactor mercilessly</a>,
 it can’t be done if the premises are to change the law, renegociate contracts
 and fear that hidden dependencies will blow somewhere. A monolith, in this
 situation, is much more flexible. You can be amazed by the refactoring
 features of your IDE, and hide behind the safety of your suite of unit tests,
 while transforming the CRM domain into a logistics solution alone in the night.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>organization can’t change</strong> to adapt to the microservice way. It still
 contains a data group, a front-end group, a back-end group, and so on. Conway’s
 law is propitious to have the services composed as a 
 <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/layered-microservices-architecture">layered microservice architecture</a>.
 Compare the diagram below with the one above:</p>

    <p><img src="./assets/organization-by-tech.png" alt=""></p>

    <p>And since different teams have different priorities, those cross-teams dependencies
 are interlocking, creating delays and conflicts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Team <strong>lacks experience and understanding of microservice</strong> concepts, DDD, or conceptual design.
 While this is not necessarily a deterrent altogether (one must start somewhere
 to get somewhere), one should follow careful documentation<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/microservices/#fn:2" class="footnote">8</a></sup> and seek advice.
 The consequences of an ill designed architecture is the creation of
 a tightly coupled distributed monolith and everything that comes with
 it: network chattiness and delays, complexity, hidden dependencies<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/microservices/#fn:7" class="footnote">9</a></sup>,
 coupling at deploy time<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/microservices/#fn:6" class="footnote">10</a></sup>, etc.</p>

    <p>Most of us enjoy learning new things, but a) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_management">that’s not <em>all</em> of us</a>,
 and b) it
 takes time and energy, repeating mistakes, including big ones, to
 learn ; and potentially to scrap v1 and restart from scratch. This is an
 investment that should be considered when deciding.</p>

    <p><em>Management</em> also needs to be comfortable with refactoring early on, or
 even starting over if <s>things are really bad</s> the learnings are strong.
 This is not natural, and is a skill that need to be acquired.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Fail often. Fail early. Fail fast. Embracing failure is a means to a successful end. 
Instead of fearing failure, become empowered by it.</p>

      <p>Gary Burnison, <a href="https://www.kornferry.com/institute/fail-fast-learn-fast">CEO of Korn Ferry</a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Embracing failure is not an easy thing to learn because of the 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment">sunk cost fallacy</a><sup id="fnref:17"><a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/microservices/#fn:17" class="footnote">11</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Team is <strong>not mature</strong><sup id="fnref:14"><a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/microservices/#fn:14" class="footnote">12</a></sup>, technical <strong>skillset is not adapted</strong><sup id="fnref:9"><a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/microservices/#fn:9" class="footnote">13</a></sup>,
  or <strong>turnover is high</strong><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/microservices/#fn:3" class="footnote">14</a></sup>.
  Since code cleanliness and architecture tend to <a href="http://www.rntz.net/post/against-software-development.html">decay
  over time</a> because
  of entropy, and since a more complex architecture is harder to maintain, this
  may exacerbate consequences of point 4.</p>

    <p>Incomprehension and pressure tends to have people <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias">fallback to what they 
  know</a>. They will cut corners
  to get things out, or just escape complexity by going the shortest path.
  And soon the architecture might get contaminated into technical components, 
  “core” libraries, references to packages from other services, orchestrators,
  “CSV Import Services”, services will start to tap into each other’s database.
  Next thing you know someone will start asking “how do we orchestrate our
  deployments to manage dependencies between services?”. This is the software
  version of hell on earth, also called a <strong>distributed monolith</strong>:</p>

    <p><img src="./assets/dependency-hell.png" alt=""></p>

    <p>The complexity of operation and debugging might imped ramp up and general
  efficiency. Complexity of investigating bugs and analyzing logs across
  services might redirect those tasks only on those more skilled team members,
  whose focus should be long term rather than fire-fighting. 
  In short - this situation is likely to
  have the team pay for all the consequences of microservices without 
  its advantages.</p>

<h1 id="then-what">Then what?</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>All software systems can be decomposed into two major elements: policy and details. The policy element embodies all the business rules and procedures. The policy is where the true value of the system lives.</p>

  <p>The details are those things that are necessary to enable humans, other systems, and programmers to communicate with the policy, but that do not impact the behavior of the policy at all. They include IO devices, databases, web systems, servers, frameworks, communication protocols, and so forth.</p>

  <p>The goal of the architect is to create a shape for the system that recognizes policy as the most essential element of the system while making the details irrelevant to that policy. <strong>This allows decisions about those details to be delayed and deferred</strong>.</p>

  <p>~ Robert C. Martin, Clean Architecture</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the application you are building has a fairly clear domain, will
undergo a considerable and variable scale, requires a large team
to be built from the get go, that you are confident in your team’s
skill and have some experience or at the very least literacy in 
distributed design, and have the management’s support to fail and
learn, microservices is a good candidate.</p>

<p>But be conscious that a microservice layout may backfire. If the current context matches 
what was described, it might be wiser to start with something simpler,
such as a monolith or a layered architecture (which may itself 
contain a few specialized services). Most of
what a microservice architecture brings can also be achieved with other solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Low coupling, scalability, and futureproof-ness</strong> is coming from a carefully planned 
<em>application</em> architecture, with clearly defined boundaries and specialized datastores.
Microservices only exacerbate that by providing physical limits. Another
way to create physical limits is through components (DLLs, JARs). The point
being that picking a component architecture and a deployment architecture
should be delayed as long as you can<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/microservices/#fn:4" class="footnote">15</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Containers and infrastructure</strong> as code can also be used with or
without a microservice architecture. And in fact, they tend to
be simpler to implement, since the networking is straight forward
and the number of configurations is less important. They still
bring the benefits of constructing and destroying environments at
will, and facilitating the creation of development environments.</p>

<p><strong>Build automation, and frequent releases</strong>, can be 
achieved through <a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/Less-WIP/">increased focus and reduced WIP</a>, <a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/Small-batches/">small batches</a>, <a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/Atomic-Change-Flow-A-simple-yet-very-effective-source-control-workflow/">atomic change flow</a>,
and reduced coordination.</p>

<p>Don’t misunderstand me, I’m painting a pretty grim image
of microservices here, while at the same time definitely
believing in the solution. Microservices are definitely
a good option for complex, distributed systems.</p>

<p>But they’re not the only one, and their
appeal tend to precipitate decisions in their favor while
disregarding the factors that were mentioned. One should
consider options and make a conscious, educated and
rational choice.</p>

      <p>Each service needs to remain independent, and at
    the same time guarantee some stability to its consumers. Each time a service modifies its API, its consumers
    need to be updated as well. But these might not be known,
    and the upgrade of their clients should not
    be on the critical path to delivering new features.
    The direct consequence is that each individual 
    microservice’s API needs to be versioned 
    individually, and old versions need to be maintained for a
    while. 
    This creates friction to change, which
    ironically might reduce your agility. The fact that cross service interaction is
    API based also removes all those nice refactoring features from your
    favorite IDE, when you want to refactor across services&nbsp;<a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/microservices/#fnref:12" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>

      <p>Since communication is happening over the network rather than in process,
    latency for each call is counted in 10s or 100s of milliseconds rather
    than fractions of nanoseconds. Assuming 100ms per service call (which
    isn’t unrealistic under load), if a call composes 3 services,
    that’s already 300ms <em>in networking alone</em>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.feval.fr/posts/microservices/#fnref:13" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>
